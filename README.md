## FAQ

### How do I install this theme?

1) Add the OsiDark folder into your Domoticz theme folder e.g. /www/styles/

2) In Domoticz goto Setup -> Settings -> Theme and pick OsiDark

### Your css uses the most ugly selectors possible

I completely agree. Unfortunately Domoticz does not provide classes on the elements, and sometimes has hardcoded styles in the HTML. Therefore I am forced to use these ugly selectors and sometimes even need to use !important.
